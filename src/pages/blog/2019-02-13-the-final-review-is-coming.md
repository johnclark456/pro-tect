Independent Review of Building Regulations and Fire Safety: final report

The reviewâ€™s final report which was commissioned by government following the Grenfell Tower fire to make recommendations on the future regulatory system.



We at Pro-Tect Ltd are waiting to see what will be said within this final review from Dame Judith Hackett. We are expecting a full shake up of the system putting much more emphasis on those in charge to make sure their employees and businesses are safe. This will include going through the proper certificated channels when any fire door is installed and making sure any older doors are professionally certified to make sure they comply with new regulations. This pressure to have all doors checked for safety will undoubtedly save many lives in this country in the years to come. 



If you would like some advice on whether the doors in your office are safe then please get in touch for a free consulation.
